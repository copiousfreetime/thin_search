## JSON1 path / performance

I’m experimenting with the json1 extension, and I’d like to confirm the proper
way to detect if a key exists in the json, vs its value being null. For example:

  sqlite> select json_extract('{"a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]}', '$.x');

  sqlite> select json_extract('{"a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]}', '$.x') IS NULL;
  1
  sqlite> select json_extract('{"x":null, "a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]}', '$.x');

  sqlite> select json_extract('{"x":null, "a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]}', '$.x') IS NULL;
  1

So far it looks as if the way to distinguish between a json key existing with a
value of null vs. not existing is to use `json_type`

  sqlite> select json_type('{"a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]}', '$.x') IS NULL;
  1
  sqlite> select json_type('{"x": null, "a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]}', '$.x');
  null

Is this correct?

Are there optimizations in place so that a column that is a json string is only
parsed once if it is involved in json1 functions? For example:

  sqlite> create table t1(doc);
  sqlite> insert into t1(doc) values(json('{"x": null, "a":2,"c":[4,5,{"f":7}]}'));
  sqlite> select json_type(doc,'$.a') IS NOT NULL, json_extract(doc, '$.a') from t1;
  1|2

In this case, is doc parsed via json twice? I'm not actually worried about
performance or anything, just wondering.
